# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
The proposed predictive model can have a significant impact on the banking sector. With the increasing competition in the credit card market, banks need to attract good clients to remain competitive. 
Introduction

# Importance of Proposal

In today's world, where the use of credit cards is increasing day by day, banks are receiving an increasing number of credit card applications. Therefore, it is essential for banks to predict the likelihood of a client's application being approved or rejected. The ability to predict good clients allows banks to make informed decisions about whom to extend credit to, which can minimize the risk of credit defaults and reduce losses for banks. This can also save time and resources for banks by avoiding unnecessary processing of applications that are likely to be rejected.

# Impact on the Banking Sector
The proposed predictive model can have a significant impact on the banking sector. With the increasing competition in the credit card market, banks need to attract good clients to remain competitive. The ability to predict good clients using a predictive model can help banks to attract clients who are less likely to default on their credit card payments.

The proposed model can also help banks to improve their risk management strategies by identifying potential high-risk clients. This can help banks to take preventive measures to minimize the risk of credit defaults.

# Knowledge Gap and Future Potential
The proposed predictive model can help fill a gap in the knowledge of credit card approval/rejection prediction. By analyzing various factors, the model can provide banks with a better understanding of the risk involved in approving a credit card application.

If required, the proposed method can be helpful for any bank in India, especially those that are looking to improve their credit card approval/rejection process. By utilizing the predictive model, banks can assess the risk of approving a credit card application accurately. Moreover, the model can be further refined and customized to the needs of individual banks, making it an effective tool for credit risk assessment.

# Hypotheses And Approaches
Based on the available dataset, here are some initial hypotheses and approaches that can be taken to answer the questions:

1.	Hypothesis: There is a relationship between credit card application features and approval/rejection status.
Approach: We can perform exploratory data analysis to identify any patterns or trends in the data, such as comparing the distribution of features for approved and rejected applications. We can also use statistical tests to determine whether there are significant differences in the means or proportions of features between the two groups.

2.	Hypothesis: Annual income, education, and employment status are the most important factors in predicting credit card application approval/rejection.
Approach: We can use feature selection methods to identify the most important features that contribute to the prediction of approval/rejection status. We can also build a machine learning model and evaluate the feature importance to confirm or refute this hypothesis.
